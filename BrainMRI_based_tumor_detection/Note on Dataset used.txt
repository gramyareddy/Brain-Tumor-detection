Dataset used
============

This dataset has been extracted from kaggle . Here's the link : https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection
The dataset originally contained just two folders with images YES and NO depicting the presence or absence of a tumor.

Hence , I have divided it up into training and test sets and have uploaded the zip file of it ....

Enjoy Deep Learning !!!
